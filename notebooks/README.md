# Jupyter Notebooks

Here you will find a set of notebooks. 
It allows to embed a redering window into a jupyter notebook via 
[K3D](https://github.com/K3D-tools/K3D-jupyter)
(or optionally with `itkwidgets` or [panel](https://github.com/pyviz/panel)).

On top of this `K3D` allows to export an interactive
[snapshot](https://vedo.embl.es/examples/K3D_snapshot.html)
of the rendered scene.
